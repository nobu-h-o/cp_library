# CP Library/Template

This repository is for storing my template and library when solving competitive programming problems in c++.
This library uses the ACL (AtCoder Library), which is available [here](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nobu-h-o/cp_library.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
